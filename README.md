# An Event-driven game
Demonstration of data races in Event-handlers

Description: An event-driven program demonstarting the usage of library 
NCurses and asynchronus IO handling for making an Animated game. 
The program installs two event-handlers, one to process asynchronus 
user input and the other to process timer events to adjust 
the speed of animation.
